# Project Structure for Blockchain Logistics Marketplace

The project is organized as follows:

```

├── main.go                      # Application entry point
├── Makefile                    # Build, run, test commands
├── README.md                   # Project overview and setup instructions

└── tests/                    # Unit and integration tests (to be created)
```

This structure separates core blockchain and marketplace logic from advanced features and integrations, facilitating modular development and testing.

Next steps:
- Install dependencies using `go get`
- Implement core smart contracts and blockchain client
- Develop REST API handlers
- Configure environment and testing framework
