# Security Considerations for Blockchain Logistics Marketplace

## Secure Private Keys
- Never commit private keys or sensitive credentials to version control systems.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to manage sensitive data.
- For production environments, consider using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves to store and manage private keys.

## Input Validation
- Validate all API inputs rigorously to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
- Use strong typing and validation libraries to enforce input constraints.
- For database interactions, always use prepared statements or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement rate limiting on APIs to mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and abuse.

## Transport Security
- Use HTTPS with modern TLS configurations to secure data in transit.
- Regularly update TLS libraries and configurations to address vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to restrict resource access.
- Add request signing and verification for critical operations to ensure authenticity and integrity.

## Additional Recommendations
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
- Implement logging and monitoring for suspicious activities.
- Educate developers and users on security best practices.
- Keep dependencies and libraries up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities.

This document should be referenced and updated regularly as part of the platform's security governance.
