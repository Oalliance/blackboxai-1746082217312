# Blockchain Logistics Marketplace in Golang

## Project Overview

This project implements a private blockchain-based logistics marketplace platform in Golang. It supports shippers, consignees, carriers, freight forwarders, and customs brokers with features including freight quotation, bidding, booking, tokenized payments, and blockchain governance.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or higher installed. Download from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Git installed. Download from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Optional: Docker for containerized services (IPFS, Ethereum nodes, etc.)

### Project Setup

1. Clone the repository (if applicable) or create a new directory:

```bash
mkdir blockchain-logistics-marketplace
cd blockchain-logistics-marketplace
```

2. Initialize Go module:

```bash
go mod init logistics-marketplace
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go get github.com/google/uuid
go get github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
go get github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api
go get github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p
```

4. Build the project:

```bash
go build -o logistics-marketplace
```

5. Run the project:

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Recommended Tools

- VSCode with Go extension for code editing and debugging
- Postman or curl for API testing
- Git for version control
